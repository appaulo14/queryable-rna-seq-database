      You blast was succesful. The zipped blast results are attached to 
      this email. If you are a windows user you can use 
      <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/">7zip</a> to unzip it. For Linux, you 
      can use gunzip to unzip it. For Mac OS X, you should be able to open it 
      without having to install anything.
