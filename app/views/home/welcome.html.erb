<h2>Welcome to the RNA-Seq Analysis pipeline.</h2>
<!--Process reads from Illumina, 454, Sanger, or some other sequencing technology.
Upload already-processed differential expression data.
Upload already-processed novel isoform data.
Upload already-processed transcripts.
Upload all three things.
Query previously-uploaded differential expression data.
Query previously-uploaded novel isoform data.
Blast against previously-uploaded transcripts.-->
<p>The RNA-Seq Analysis Pipeline provides a place to store and query the results 
from rna-seq processsing. Additionally, it provides facilities to do the rna-seq 
processing itself and then store the ressults for querying.</p>
<p>One can query both differential expression data and novel isoform data and 
also BLAST against transcript sequences.</p>
