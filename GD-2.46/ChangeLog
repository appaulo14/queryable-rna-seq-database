2.46    Added a basic "use" test for GD::Simple
2.45	Clarified the GD license. There is now a formal LICENSE file in the package.
2.44    GD::Group now installed properly.
	Quenched compiler warning caused by Newxs() calls.
2.43    Added "transparent" color to GD::Simple.

2.41    Added backend support for grouping features in GD::SVG module.
2.40    ** Do not use - contains a bug **
2.39	Makefile.PL will refuse to run if the proper version of libgd is unavailable.
2.38	Fixed bizarre warning about /usr/include/gd.h != /usr/include/gd.h.
2.37	GD/Image.pm did not bring in croak() properly, meaning that incorrect error messages are printed out when any of the newFromXXX() calls are made.
2.36	Instructions on using gdAntiAliased with palette images.
2.35	Some instructions on installation for Windows users.
	Doesn't push libpng onto @LIBS unless png support is requested.
	Supports Storable's freeze/thaw via a custom serializer.
	Remove "scale redefined" message during compilation of Polyline.
2.34    Added a check for stray gd.h include files from older installations. If any are
	      found, Makefile.PL will issue a warning.
	Fixed incorrect documentation of GD::Simple->string() method. The method call
	      *does* move the pen.
2.33	Added appropriate #ifdefs to allow to compile under version 5.6.0 (due to lack of
	      threading macros before 5.8).
2.32	Added a GD::Simple->HSVtoRGB() method.
	Documentation fixes from Mark Manning.
	Added a clear() method to GD::Polygon to remove all vertices.
2.31	Fixed GD::Simple->transparent to support symbolic color names.

2.29	Better support for fonts and brushed patterns in GD::Simple
2.28	Having troubles getting all the modules installed correctly. Should work now.
2.27	Reworked the way that GD.pm is created at compile time so that CPAN picks up
	   correct version information. No code changes.
2.26    CPAN isn't propagating GD, so I'll upload another version
2.25    Fixed Makefile.PL so that GD::Polyline and GD::Simple are installed (thanks to Guy Albertelli).
	
2.24	Fixed gif/anim gif support so that you can't have animated gif support without
		having gif support.
	
2.23	Added patch from Slaven Rezic which makes it possible to call GD constants
		in an OO way (without generating warnings), and removes #! from the
		top of autogenerated GD.pm
	Rewrote tests 11 and 12 - if they continue to randomly fail on various
		platforms, they will be removed.
2.22	Changed the way the gd and gd2 round-trip tests are evaluated. This
		might fix test failures that have been reported on some platforms.
2.21    Regression tests are now functional for versions of libgd compiled
	exclusively with PNG, JPEG or GIF support.
2.20	GD::Image->newFromGdData() and newFromGd2Data() got broken
		somewhere along the line.  They are now fixed (and
		have a regression test).

		have the gdImageStringFTCircle() function.

	Documentation fixes.
2.16	Fixed bug in GIF #IFDEFs pointed out by BZAJAC
	Added #IFDEF for WIN32 provided by Randy Kobes
2.15	Brought back GIF support (requires libgd 2.0.28 or higher).
	Takes advantage of gdlib-config support in libgd 2.0.27 or higher.
2.14	Support for AMD64 libraries.
2.12	Fixed regression test 10 to succeed when used with
		libgd 2.0.22
2.11	More alpha functions from Cory Watson
2.10	Suppress CAPI warning.

	Added extended options to stringFT().
	Added filledArc(), ellipse() and filledEllipse() methods.
	Added command-line options to Makefile.PL provided by David Eisenberg.
2.06	Added saveAlpha() and alphaBlending() methods.

	Changed the context member from free to gd_free to allow for compiling.
	Fixed the regression tests since the gd-generated images have changed slightly.
2.03	Skipped so as to remain version number compatible with libgd.
2.02	Changed Math::Trig version requirement from 0.0 to 1.0 as Perl 5.8
	no long recognizes this as a valid version number.
2.01	Added Math::Trig to the prerequisites because GD::Polyline needs it.
2.00    Folded in support for gd version 2.0 from Dan Palermo
	Folded in support for splines (GD::Polyline) from Dan Harasty.
	Removed all GIF support.
1.43    Added demo of Type1 fonts to truetype demo from Slaven Rezic.
