qd.pl -- a Perl interface to Macintosh Quickdraw routines

qd.pl allows you to create Macintosh PICT files from within Perl.  You
can download them to Macintosh systems, open the pictures up, and manipulate
them with standard Macintosh drawing tools.

To install, just copy qd.pl into /usr/local/lib/perl, or wherever your
perl libraries are kept.  The documentation, somewhat crude, is
contained within the qd.pl file itself.
